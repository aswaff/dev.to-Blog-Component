# dev.to-Blog-Component

This component fetches article data from dev.to, and without having to rebuild the site, shows all current and updated articles of a user.

This component was made for Gatsby, however with a few tweaks it could be used with most any framework.

If you are using with Gatsby, make sure to copy the gatsby-node.js, this gets run at build time and allows @reach/router to do make the pages using /blog/*.
